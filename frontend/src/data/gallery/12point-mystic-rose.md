This intricate pattern is made with very simple rules. Every point is connect to every other point.

It is easier if you label the points from 1 to 12 and start connecting.

You go this way:

```
1 to 2 - back to 1
1 to 3 - back to 1
...
1 to 12 - back to 2
2 to 3 - back to 2
2 to 4 - back to 2
...
```

Notice that when you start at point 2, you don't connect it to point 1, which is already connected when you connected point 1 with every other point. If you miss that you may get some double lines, as it is the case with this design.

 This design of connecting every point to every other point is called a `Mystic Rose`. You could try the same pattern with circular templates of any number of holes.
