The String Art advanced kit contains 10 carefully selected precision cut templates to make stunning creations. This kit is for advanced users and contains bigger templates.

Unlike the starter kit, where the string art can be made just by looping a thread, many of the templates in this kit require working with a need as the some of the holes are in the center of the piece rather than at the periphery. Because of that it usualy takes more effort and takes longer to work with templates in this kit. Needless to say, the final output would be so wonderful that it is all worth the effort.
